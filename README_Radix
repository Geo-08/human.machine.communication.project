make to compile
first run ./ctest x, x being an integer.
It will create a file named "test_case" with x tuples, in a format of key,payload. The keys will be randomized while payload will be numbers from 0....x
then run ./testrade x, it will read x tuples from the "test_case" file and put them in a relation.
It will then check if the relation is sorted in respect to the key, the expected result is that they won't be sorted.
Then it will call the function radix_sort(relation *rel,int depth) to sort the relation.
The result relation will be checked to see if it's sorted, the expected result is that it will be sorted.
And it will be printed on a file named "test_case_sorted"
